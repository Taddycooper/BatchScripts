# BatchScripts

Just some batchscripts for me to practice while I am still learning how to code

Feel free to use, modify, and experiment with my code. Just please, no malware. In my opinion malware is unacceptable and should not be used under any circumstances.

thanks for checking out my github repo and thanks be to Jesus for giving me the skill of scripting! Thanks!
